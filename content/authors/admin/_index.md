I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), working with Professor [Yanxun Xu](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~yxu70/). My research interests lie in developing Bayesian statistical theory and methods for a broad range of problems, including Bayesian nonparametrics, dynamic treatment regimes, reinforcement learning, causal discovery, graphical models, and longitudinal data analysis. I also conduct interdisciplinary research by developing novel Bayesian methods for various applications, including electronic health/medical record data, precision medicine in HIV, early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and proportional reasoning in cognitive science.

**[News]** 06/24/2024: My PhD dissertation [Novel Bayesian Methods for Precision Medicine in HIV](https://bluejw.github.io/publication/dissertation/) was selected as a finalist for the [Leonard J. Savage Dissertation Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/) by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA)! I will give a presentation in the special Savage Award session at the [2024 ISBA World Meeting](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home) in Venice, Italy, on July 5th.

**[News]** 01/23/2024: Check out [Media Coverage](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/news/researchers-develop-personalized-therapy-decision-making-framework-to-optimize-hiv-treatment/) on our recently published paper [A Bayesian Decision Framework for Optimizing Sequential Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in People with HIV](https://bluejw.github.io/publication/optimal_decision/) in **Annals of Applied Statistics**!

**[News]** 01/02/2024: Our paper [A Bayesian Approach for Investigating the Pharmacogenetics of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in People with HIV](https://bluejw.github.io/publication/pharmacogenetics/) has been accepted by **Biostatistics**!

**[News]** 09/20/2023: Our paper [Common Antiretroviral Combinations are Associated with Somatic Depressive Symptoms in Women with HIV](https://bluejw.github.io/publication/common_cart/) has been accepted by **AIDS**!

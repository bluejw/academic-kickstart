Welcome to my homepage! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), working with Professor [Yanxun Xu](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~yxu70/). My PhD dissertation won the [Leonard J. Savage Dissertation Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/).

My research interests lie in developing Bayesian statistical theory and methods for a broad range of problems, including Bayesian nonparametrics, dynamic treatment regimes, causal discovery, and longitudinal data analysis. I also conduct interdisciplinary research by developing novel Bayesian methods for various applications, including electronic health/medical record data, precision medicine in HIV, and early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
